## Negation in Classical and Constructive Logic

We now turn to the interplay between negation and the two logics.
DeMorgan's laws expose the first asymmetry: some directions hold
constructively and some need an extra classical assumption. From
there we distinguish proof by negation from proof by contradiction,
and isolate excluded middle as the single assumption that bridges
the gap.

### DeMorgan's Laws

For arbitrary propositions P and Q, negation distributes over
disjunction in both directions, constructively:
  ¬(P ∨ Q) ↔ (¬P ∧ ¬Q).

For conjunction, only (¬P ∨ ¬Q) → ¬(P ∧ Q) holds constructively
in general. The reverse implication,
  ¬(P ∧ Q) → (¬P ∨ ¬Q),
does not: knowing that P and Q cannot both hold does not give us
a choice of which one to refute. A proof of the disjunction must
provide either a proof of ¬P or a proof of ¬Q. Excluded middle
would let us split on P, but is not available constructively.

Trying the reverse direction: choose the left disjunct, ¬P,
and assume P. To use ¬(P ∧ Q) to get False, we still need Q,
but nothing supplies it. Choosing the right disjunct instead
leaves the symmetric problem of needing P.

`#guard_msgs` checks the expected error, so this intentionally
unfinished attempt does not prevent the file from compiling.

### Proof by Negation and by Contradiction

Constructively, we can prove ¬P by assuming P and deriving False:
that is exactly what a proof of P → False does. The theorem above
uses this reasoning to prove that P and ¬P cannot both hold. This
*proof strategy* is properly called *proof by negation*. It is not
*proof by contradiction*, even though deriving a contradiction is
the key step.

But suppose we want to prove P by assuming ¬P and deriving False.
What we have constructed is (¬P → False), which is ¬¬P. In general,
constructive logic does not let us turn this into a proof of P.
This extra step is called double-negation elimination, or the
classical rule of proof by contradiction.

Here is where a term-mode attempt gets stuck. `False.elim` can
produce P from False, but to get False from `notNotP` we must
supply a proof of ¬P. We have no such proof. The hole below asks
for exactly that missing input. This illustrates the obstruction;
a failed attempt alone is not a proof of unprovability.

### One Additional Assumption: Excluded Middle

Put a single additional assumption on the left of an implication:

  (∀ P : Prop, P ∨ ¬P) → (∀ P : Prop, ¬¬P → P).

Call the supplied proof `em`. Its type is ∀ P : Prop, P ∨ ¬P.
Under Curry-Howard, this is a machine: give it any proposition P,
and `em P` gives us a *proof* of P ∨ ¬P, for free! We supply no
evidence about P. Its output is a proof-bearing disjunction:
either `Or.inl p`, carrying a proof p of P, or `Or.inr notP`,
carrying a proof notP of ¬P. It is not just a Boolean answer.
We are assuming this machine, not implementing a constructive
algorithm that decides every proposition.

Now split on the proof `em P`. In the first case we already have
the desired proof of P. In the second case we have precisely the
proof of ¬P missing above. Applying `notNotP` to it gives False,
and `False.elim` turns that contradiction into a proof of P.

        | Or.inl p => p
        | Or.inr notP => False.elim (notNotP notP)

All steps in this proof are constructive uses of the supplied
assumption. The classical power comes from `em`: keeping it on
the left makes explicit what the proof-by-contradiction rule needs.

## Constructive and Classical Logic in Lean

Constructive logic requires evidence for the claims we make;
it does not supply P ∨ ¬P for every arbitrary proposition P.
Classical logic adds excluded middle (or an equivalent principle),
so general proof by contradiction becomes available. Both logics
allow us to derive any proposition from a proof of False.

In Lean, we can write `open Classical` and then use `em P` to
obtain a proof of P ∨ ¬P. Opening the namespace only makes names
such as `Classical.em` available as `em`; it does not itself make
a proof classical. Using this principle supplies the classical
power. We can also write `Classical.em P` without opening anything.
Although we often call excluded middle an axiom of classical logic,
Lean's `Classical.em` is a theorem derived using its underlying
axioms, including classical choice.

The example below supplies the proof machine from Lean's library,
so we no longer need to ask for it as an explicit assumption.
The two cases are exactly the ones in our previous proof.

Here is the full type of the library's excluded-middle theorem:

  Classical.em : ∀ (P : Prop), P ∨ ¬P

It takes a proposition P and returns a proof of P ∨ ¬P, with no
proof about P required as input. `#check` displays its type;
`#print` displays its actual definition, including the library's
proof body. We use this existing theorem rather than declare a
new axiom.

Here then is the elimination rule for negation, which is *not*
constructively valid.

## The Tradeoff: Proofs Without Executable Constructions

With `em`, we gain the general rule of proof by contradiction:
from ¬¬P we can prove P. The price is that our proof now relies
on a machine for which we have no executable implementation.
`em P` supplies a proof of P ∨ ¬P, but it is not an algorithm
we can run to discover which side holds for an arbitrary P.

Look again at the match above. Each branch tells us what to do
with its evidence: return p, or derive False from notP. Those
branches are explicit, but `em` does not supply executable code
to select a branch. Thus this proof of ¬¬P → P is a valid logical
construction, not a general executable procedure for turning a
proof of ¬¬P into a constructively computed proof of P.

Lean still checks the entire proof term, including both branches;
classical reasoning does not bypass proof checking. What we lose
is the guarantee of a computational interpretation for this step.
In Lean, proofs in `Prop` are erased during compilation anyway,
including constructive proofs. So going classical does not delete
existing program code. Rather, using `em` adds a logical capability
without adding an executable implementation of that capability.

For a worked example of what this costs in practice, see the odd
perfect number question in `E07_Exists.lean`, where a one-line
classical proof settles that an existential has an answer and
still leaves us with no code to compute it.
